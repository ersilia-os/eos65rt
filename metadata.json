    "Title": "Membrane permeability of fluorescent probes",
    "Description": "A deep neural network was trained to predict the LogP value of small molecules and fluorescent probes using an experimentally annotated dataset of >13k molecules (OPERA). This dataset was complemented with fluorescent probes to improve the model accuracy in this space. Probes predicted impermeant to cell membranes consistently showed experimental LogP <1.",
